_THIS PROJECT WAS A PART OF HACKTJ2023_

## Inspiration üîÆ 
We drew inspiration for this problem after hearing constant complaints from our parents about finding a doctor. A few common complaints always arose: "It always takes so long to get a doctor" and "It's never the right doctor." With a little bit of research into the healthcare industry, we realized there was a _real_ problem with the medical system. Medical professionals are often understaffed, and time becomes increasingly valuable for both patients and medical professionals. Additionally, we found that a common waste of time in the healthcare industry, we **improper** appointments, a.k.a. people going to the wrong doctor. Thus, we created DoctorDirect to **solve all of these problems**.

## What it does ‚≠ê
Our website receives user inputs which include user preferences regarding their values, such as environmental, social good, governance, racial diversity, gender diversity, and controversy. Using a KNN model and data on the top 100 companies listen on the biggest U.S. stock exchanges, the machine learning model is able to classify the medical conditions to the inputted symptoms. DoctorDirect currently recognizes 132 symptoms which classify into 40 diseases/medical conditions. Once the disease is classified using the symptoms received from user input, the model matches it to a medical professional

## What's in this Repo? üìë

1. static - Folder of CSS formatting and background images
2. templates - Folder of HTML web development files
3. doctorReturn.py - Returns a list of doctors and medical specialists for a specific disease
4. doctorOutput.py - Returns the type of doctor that would treat a given disease with an input of its symptoms
5. finalized_modevl.sav - The trained SVC model
6. main.py - The FLASK file which connects all components of this project

## How we built it üî®
For the machine learning model, we used Google Colab with downloaded datasets to Google drive as the two have a close affinity to each other. The dataset was arranged into a data frame format and used an SVC with "symptoms" as data and "disease" as labels. The "symptoms" have weights labeled to scale which allows some symptoms to have a greater effect on the result of some medical conditions. The model was trained with an 85:15 split between training and testing points which returned a 93 percent accuracy. Using the data frame .iloc function, we created multiple methods so our inputs could adapt to the model. This model accurately assigned specific diseases and medical specialties to the symptom user inputs. 

Then using webscraping techniques, we sought out medical professionals based on location and specialty. Libraries such as cloudscraper, requests, beautifulsoup4, and more, were used to seek all **qualified** medical professionals for the treatment that the user may need. This was done by scraping medical websites, geographical maps, and basic search queries.

Lastly, all of this was seamlessly merged onto a dynamic web platform. Connecting our python files to the typical web dev files, we used Flask to connect all of our models and files to integrate it into a web app, which is hosted on Heroku.

## What's next for Doctor Direct üèÜ
Currently, we recognize 42 medical conditions and 132 symptoms. We plan to expand the symptoms and medical conditions to cover a greater range including physical injuries and mental illnesses. Additionally, we can continue to expand onto our website, linking APIs from hospitals directly to our services. This would allow for a more ubiquitous and thorough service.
